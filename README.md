Hello! My name is Peter and I was born also lived in Shanghai, China. I like playing badminton, travelling and playing computer games. Especially moba games which I can carry my teammates.

This summer I've done a lot of things. I travelled to Tokyo, Japan, Mogan Mountain, and Sanya. These are all magnificent tourist attractions and I got much relaxation from them. After the trips, I started learning how to drive and going to get my driving license this month. At the same time, I attended the Harvard Summit for Young Leader in China, learning from 3 different topics while making a lot of friends. The last activity I attended was Peer Mock Trial, which was also an unforgettable experience with 2 other NYUSH students, who have been good friends of mine.

The positive change I've personally experienced as a result of applications of the Internet is Ali Pay, Wechat and Taobao, which all bring us huge convenience.

For the negative impacts I've personally experienced. The online payment always has some problems and is not very secure, therefore we can strengthen the regulations in those apps. The second one is that most of the music apps' recommendation songs aren't very satisfactory, so it can be improved by editing the recommendation algorithm. Last one is when I watching movies through the browers, there're always many ads popping out which are very annoying.So we can mitigate this effect by establishing a more effective blocking system for the browers.
